# TheHobbitGamePython


The purpose of this text adventure is to briefly experience the case scenario of being in the shire and being confused by Bilbo. The game is based on Tolkienâ€™s The Hobbit and it includes excerpts of this book. The game is based on probabilities according to what the user responds in the beginning (smelly feet and sense of adventure).

This was a course project for Data Science with Python at Hult International Business School.
